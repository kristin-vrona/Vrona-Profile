# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/kristin-vrona/Vrona-Profile/blob/master/assets/images/gradpicbenny.jpeg?raw=true" width="35%" hspace="20" align="right">

My name is Kristin Vrona. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Northern Illinois University, where I also completed my M.A. in Economics. 

**I am currently on the job market and open for inter interviews.**

My primary fields for my doctorate were applied econometrics and labor economics, but I also have research experience in health economics and strategy & game theory. 

I am hoping to expand the breadth of my career to industry settings, whether using my robust experience with data science in an Analyst position or using my broader knowledge of economic theory and econometrics to conduct hypothesis testing that informs business outcomes to acheive big-picture goals under various pressures.


### Field Background

With 9 years of experience in big data management, I have an aptitude for extracting and compiling complex datasets, building narratives through data visualization, and applying statistical methods to assess validity and reliability of data-driven models. 

My field experience includes supporting the effective allocation of $59 million in public funding and driving significant cost-saving initiatives in the private sector through process improvement and strategic analysis.


### Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, you’ll often find me training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, writing and performing music, or enjoying long walks.
