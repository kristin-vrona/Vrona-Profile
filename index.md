Hello — I’m Kristin Vrona, a PhD economist (Northern Illinois University, August 2025) specializing in labor, health, and applied econometrics. I turn rigorous economic methods into actionable insight through transparent, reproducible research and production-ready data analysis. I’m comfortable leading end-to-end projects independently and collaborating in fast-paced teams across industry, public-resource management, and consulting. I bring 10+ years of applied data-science experience and a commitment to clear communication about methods, limitations, and policy implications.
