# Welcome to my homepage!

I'm **Kristin Vrona**, a recent Ph.D. graduate in Economics from Northern Illinois University.

> **I am currently on the job market and available for interviews.**

My doctoral specializations are in **econometrics** and **labor economics**, and I’ve developed a strong foundation in **health economics** through extensive research projects. I'm also deeply interested in **strategy** and **game theory**.

With over **ten years of experience in coding and data analysis**, I thrive in data science and process improvement—especially the aspects many find most frustrating, which I find intellectually rewarding.


I’m primarily seeking a **fast-paced industry environment** where I can apply my expertise to solve complex problems and improve systems. I am also open to **relocation** for the right opportunity.

### Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, you’ll often find me training in Jiu-Jitsu, writing and performing music, or enjoying long walks with my pup, Benny.
