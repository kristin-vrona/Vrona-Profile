# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/kristin-vrona/Vrona-Profile/blob/master/assets/images/gradpicbenny.jpeg?raw=true" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

My name is Kristin Vrona. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Northern Illinois University. My degree fields were labor economics and econometrics, but I have also expanded my research to the areas of health economics, strategy & game theory, and policy implementation.

**I am currently on the job market and available to interview** 

I am primarily seeking a fast-paced corporate environment to flex my learned expertise developed during my time in academia. I am open to discussing relocation for the right fit. 



### Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, you’ll often find me training in Jiu-Jitsu, writing and performing music, or enjoying long walks with my pup, Benny.
