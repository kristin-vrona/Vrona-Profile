# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/kristin-vrona/Vrona-Profile/blob/master/assets/images/Vrona Kristin.jpeg?raw=true" width="35%" hspace="20" align="right">

My name is Kristin Vrona. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Northern Illinois University, where I also completed my M.A. in Economics. My doctorate specializations include labor economics and applied econometrics.  

**I am currently on the job market and open to interviews. I am also willing to discuss relocation.**

My research often integrates labor economics with health economics and public policy analysis, using advanced econometric models to drive meaningful insights that are robust and pose minimal bias. I have also stepped outsideo of my core fields to conduct studies in game theory and strategic behavior and look forward to continuing to develop these skills.


### Field Background

With over ten years of experience in big data management, I have a passion for extracting and compiling complex datasets, building narratives through data visualization, and applying econometric methods to assess real-world outcomes. My work often bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insight by automating visual reports and incorporating macroeconomic and institution-specific factors into predictive analyses.

My field experience includes supporting the effective allocation of $59 million in public funding and driving significant cost-saving initiatives in the private sector through process improvement and strategic analysis.



### Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, you’ll often find me training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, writing and performing music, or enjoying long walks.
