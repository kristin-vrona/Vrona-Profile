# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/kristin-vrona/Vrona-Profile/blob/master/assets/images/gradpicbenny.jpeg?raw=true" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

Hello! My name is Kristin Vrona and I am a recent PhD graduate in Economics from Northern Illinois University. 

My doctoral field specializations are econometrics and labor economics, though I have also gained deep knowledge in the realm of health economics through my reearch endeavours. I have also spent time in the fields of strategy & game theory, which I find particularly stimulating.

**I am currently on the job market and available for interviews.** 

I am primarily seeking a fast-paced corporate environment to flex my learned expertise developed during my time in academia. I am open to discussing relocation for the right fit. 



### Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, you’ll often find me training in Jiu-Jitsu, writing and performing music, or enjoying long walks with my pup, Benny.
