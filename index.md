Hello — I’m Kristin Vrona, a PhD economist (Northern Illinois University, August 2025) specializing in labor, health, and applied econometrics. I turn rigorous economic methods into actionable insight through transparent, reproducible research and production-ready data analysis.

With 10+ years of experience in data-driven analysis, I am confident leading end-to-end projects independently and in fast-paced collaborative environments.
