## Welcome.

I'm Kristin Vrona, an economist and data analyst with over 9 years of applied experience. 

> **I am currently on the job market and available for interviews.**

My doctoral specializations are in **econometrics** and **labor economics**, and I’ve developed a strong foundation in **health economics** through extensive research projects. I'm also deeply interested in **strategy** and **game theory**.

With over **ten years of experience in coding and data analysis**, I thrive in data science and process improvement—especially the aspects many find most frustrating, which I find intellectually rewarding.

I am seeking a role that compliments my aptitude for the timely development of innovative solutions and pass these solutions on to improve efficiency within organizations whether it be through strong narrative and visualization presented to stakeholders, or training a colleague on each stage of the improved process.

### Outside of Work

Outside of the workplace, you’ll often find me training in Jiu-Jitsu, writing and performing music, or enjoying long walks with my pup, Benny.
