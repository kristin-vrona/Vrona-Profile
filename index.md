Hello — I’m Kristin Vrona, a PhD economist (Northern Illinois University, August 2025) specializing in labor, health, and applied econometrics. I turn rigorous economic methods into actionable insight through transparent, reproducible research and production-ready data analysis.

> **I am currently on the job market and available for interviews.**

I am confident leading end-to-end projects independently and in fast-paced collaborative endvironments and bring 10+ years of applied data-science experience. Clear communication throughout the research process is a top priority for me and I ensure transaparency about methods, limitations, and project scope. 

Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn, Job Openings for Economists (JOE), or via email (see Contact tab). 

In my spare time, I write and perform music, go on long walks with my giant pup, Benny, and spend as much time outdoors as possible before the Midwest winters kick in.
