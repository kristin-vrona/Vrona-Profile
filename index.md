Hello — I’m Kristin Vrona, a PhD economist (Northern Illinois University, August 2025) specializing in labor, health, and applied econometrics. I turn rigorous economic methods into actionable insight through transparent, reproducible research and production-ready data analysis. I’m comfortable leading end-to-end projects independently and collaborating in fast-paced teams across industry, public-resource management, and consulting. 

I bring 10+ years of applied data-science experience and a commitment to clear communication about methods, limitations, and policy implications.

Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn, Job Openings for Economists (JOE), or via email (see Contact tab). 

In my spare time, I write and perform music, go on long walks with my giant pup, Benny, and spend as much time outdoors as possible before the Midwest winter months kick in.
