**Job Market Paper:**  K. Vrona, "Labor Supply Dynamics Among Employed Workers with Mental Illness"

  **Abstract:** This study explores the complex relationship between mental health, physical health, and absenteeism for employed adult using data pulled from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) years 2010 – 2014, separating analyses by sex. The focus of the paper is to examine whether diagnosed mental illness improves or amplifies absenteeism of workers, conditional on other measurements of health status. Robust results reveal that men and with mental health diagnosis show fewer absences under higher distress and physical health diagnoses of chronic conditions. Gender differences emerge as well: while women’s absence behavior remains stable regardless of high self-reports of physical health fluctuations, men exhibit marked sensitivity to this metric physical health, suggesting that diagnosis may prompt preemptive health management or influence cautious behavior aimed at minimizing health risks. Mental illness affects over 1 in 5 adults in the US each year, regardless of diagnostic status. Thus, it is impossible for employers to screen out this issue during hiring processes – not to mention the dynamic nature of compounding or just beginning symptoms. These findings contribute to understanding how mental health diagnosis timing and gender shape absenteeism and underscores the need for tailored mental health support in workforce policies (i.e, no carve-outs or violations of parity law) if the goal is to maximize labor productivity with fewer turnover costs.

K. Vrona, "The Role of Individual Health Patterns and Endogenous Employment on Absenteeism"

  **Abstract:** This paper examines the question often present in behavioral models of health - the bias that can persist across estimates when unobserved factors drive behavior. In the context of this study, individuals may select into employment non-randomly. For instance, ability to balance health issues while being productive.  When these possibilities are ignored, the magnitude of the effect that mental illness has on absenteeism is likely underestimated. A classic Heckman selection model, supported by strong exclusion restrictions, suggests the presence of endogenous sample selection that is validated by a semi-parametric copula-based selection model that accommodates the discrete and overdispersed nature of absence data.
